# 🎯 Projector & Air Conditioner Detection with YOLOv8

This repository contains my custom object detection project using **YOLOv8**.  
The goal of this project is to train a lightweight deep learning model capable of detecting two specific objects: **projectors** and **air conditioners**.  

By building a custom dataset and training YOLOv8 on it, the model learns to recognize these objects in real-world images and videos.  
This project demonstrates how to:
- 📂 Prepare and organize a dataset
- 📝 Annotate images with bounding boxes
- ⚡ Train YOLOv8 on custom classes
- 🔍 Run inference to detect projectors and air conditioners

The repository includes the dataset structure, configuration file (`data.yaml`), and training scripts so you can reproduce the results or adapt them for your own custom objects.
